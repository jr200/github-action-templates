# Cross-Org Reusable Workflow & GitHub App Gotchas

This repo (`jr200-labs/github-action-templates`) hosts reusable workflows
called by consumer repos across multiple GitHub orgs. Every gotcha below
was discovered the hard way during the initial setup (April 2026).
GitHub's docs either don't cover these or bury them.

---

## 1. Org-level secrets don't cross org boundaries via `secrets: inherit`

`secrets: inherit` on a reusable workflow call **does not pass org-level
secrets across org boundaries**. A repo in one org calling a reusable
workflow in another org will NOT inherit the caller org's secrets.

Confusingly, `vars.*` (variables) DO cross orgs via the same mechanism —
only secrets are blocked.

**Workaround:** Declare the secret as a named input on the reusable
workflow's `workflow_call.secrets` block. The caller passes it explicitly:

```yaml
# Consumer wrapper (in a different org than the reusable workflow)
secrets:
  INTEGRATION_APP_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.INTEGRATION_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

Once you declare ANY named secret on `workflow_call.secrets`, only the
named ones flow through — you lose the magic inherit behaviour for that
workflow, even within the same org.

**Example:** `.github/workflows/renovate.yml` in this repo declares
`INTEGRATION_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` as a named optional secret for exactly
this reason.

---

## 2. GitHub Free plan blocks org-level secrets/variables on private repos

Org-level secrets and variables with `visibility: all` do NOT resolve at
workflow runtime for **private** repositories on the **GitHub Free plan**.
The API misleadingly reports `visibility: all` regardless of plan.

**Root cause:** GitHub Free only propagates org secrets/variables to
public repos. Orgs where all repos are private see org inheritance
blocked; orgs on Free with public repos don't hit this.

**Workaround:** Add per-repo duplicates of the variable + secret on
every private repo that needs them:

```bash
gh variable set INTEGRATION_APP_ID --repo <org>/<repo> --body "<app-id>"
gh secret set INTEGRATION_APP_PRIVATE_KEY --repo <org>/<repo> < key.pem
```

**Long-term fix:** Upgrade to GitHub Team ($4/user/month). Then delete
all per-repo duplicates — the org-level settings take effect immediately.

**Tracked in:** consumer-org issue tracker (per-org investigation + upgrade decision).

---

## 3. `secrets.*` not allowed in `if:` expressions

You cannot reference `secrets.X` in a step-level or job-level `if:`
condition. GitHub Actions evaluates `if:` expressions before secrets are
bound to the step context.

**Workaround:** Pair every secret with a non-sensitive variable. Gate
on the variable:

```yaml
- name: Mint App installation token
  if: ${{ vars.INTEGRATION_APP_ID != '' }}
  uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v3
  with:
    app-id: ${{ vars.INTEGRATION_APP_ID }}
    private-key: ${{ secrets.INTEGRATION_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

---

## 4. Org-level variables don't resolve inside cross-org reusable workflows

Even when org variables are visible via the API, `vars.*` inside a
reusable workflow resolves from the **caller's** context. On private
repos (Free plan), the caller can't see org-level variables.

**Workaround:** Pass the variable from the caller's `with:` block:

```yaml
# Consumer wrapper
with:
  app-id: ${{ vars.INTEGRATION_APP_ID }}
```

The reusable workflow uses `inputs.app-id` instead of `vars.INTEGRATION_APP_ID`:

```yaml
if: ${{ inputs.app-id != '' || vars.INTEGRATION_APP_ID != '' }}
```

The fallback to `vars.*` keeps backward compat for callers that haven't
been updated. See the `app-id` input on `renovate.yml` in this repo.

---

## 5. App tokens bypass "Allow Actions to create PRs" setting

The org-level setting **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull
requests"** (Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions) only
controls `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`. App installation tokens minted via
`actions/create-github-app-token` **bypass this setting entirely**.

**Symptom if disabled:** Workflows using `GITHUB_TOKEN` fail with:
`GraphQL: GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests`

**Fix:** Enable at the org level, or use App tokens (which bypass it).

---

## 6. `workflows:write` permission needed for workflow file changes

Without the `workflows:write` permission on the GitHub App, pushes that
modify `.github/workflows/*.yml` are rejected — even for innocent
changes like bumping `actions/checkout` version.

The per-org integration Apps used for this workflow all have this
permission.

---

## 7. `secrets: inherit` is silent on failure

If a caller forgets `secrets: inherit` (or the explicit `secrets:` block),
the reusable workflow simply doesn't see any secrets. **No error, no
warning.** The App token mint step silently falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

**How to detect:** After wiring a new consumer, trigger a manual
`workflow_dispatch` and check the logs. Look for:
- "Mint App installation token" step: ✓ (ran) vs - (skipped)
- The `app-id:` line in the step's `with:` block: `***` (present) vs empty

---

## 8. `renovatebot/github-action` has no floating major tag

`@v44`, `@v46` don't exist — there's no floating major tag. Pin to a
specific patch version like `@v46.1.8`. Renovate itself can be bumped
independently via the action's `renovate-version` input (currently
defaults to `43`).

---

## 9. Renovate's zod schemas reject some valid YAML

`pnpm-workspace.yaml` containing `overrides: null` (perfectly valid
YAML and accepted by pnpm) crashes Renovate's npm extractor with a
zod validation error.

**Workaround:** Remove the `overrides: null` line.

---

## 10. Rolling back image tags is fragile — Renovate undoes it

If you roll back a deployment by pinning an older image tag in
a consumer repo's IaC `values.yaml`, Renovate sees the newer (broken)
tag as "latest" and bumps it back on the next run.

**Correct approach:**
1. Publish a NEW version with the fix (so the broken version is no
   longer "latest")
2. Mark the broken version's GitHub Release as pre-release
   (`gh release edit <tag> --prerelease`) — Renovate skips pre-releases

**Safety net:** Consumer IaC repos can wire a `.githooks/pre-commit`
that automatically marks skipped versions as pre-release when it detects
a tag downgrade in values.yaml.

---

## 11. `create-github-app-token@v3` is stricter about PEM format

After Renovate bumped `actions/create-github-app-token` from `@v2` to
`@v3`, some per-repo `INTEGRATION_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` secrets stopped
working with: `A JSON web token could not be decoded`.

**Fix:** Re-set the secret with a fresh `.pem` file:

```bash
gh secret set INTEGRATION_APP_PRIVATE_KEY --repo <repo> < key.pem
```

For v3 workflows, prefer `client-id`. Older `app-id` usage can still
appear in historical workflow runs and should be moved opportunistically.

---

## 12. Caller top-level `permissions:` can silently break reusable workflows

When a caller workflow sets top-level `permissions:` that doesn't include
every scope the reusable workflow's jobs need, the whole run can fail with
`startup_failure` — **before any job logs are emitted**. The UI shows
0 jobs, duration ~1s, and the API returns no annotations.

Observed when first adopting `release_please.yaml` on a private repo:
the caller had `permissions: contents: read` at top level; the
reusable's release job declares `contents: write, pull-requests: write`.
Startup failed immediately.

Confusingly, the identical pattern works on some repos — suggesting the
cascade depends on org-level/repo-level workflow permission defaults
(`default_workflow_permissions`, `can_approve_pull_request_reviews`)
that differ silently between repos.

**Workaround:** Always declare the full set of scopes the reusable needs
at the caller's top-level `permissions:` block. For release-please:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
```

Also add `workflow_dispatch:` to the trigger list so you can retrigger
manually for diagnosis without needing a push to master.

**How to detect:** Watch the first post-merge workflow run. If it shows
`startup_failure` with 1s duration and no job logs, suspect permissions
before touching YAML syntax.

**Refactor gotcha:** When converting an inline job to a reusable
workflow call, promote job-level `permissions:` to the caller's
top-level block. Job-level grants supersede top-level for inline jobs
but do NOT cascade into a reusable workflow — only the caller's
top-level `permissions:` propagates. A refactor that swaps
`jobs.foo.runs-on + jobs.foo.permissions` for `jobs.foo.uses:` while
leaving top-level `permissions: contents: read` will silently regress
to `startup_failure` on every run. Observed in the wild: an inline
release-please job with `contents: write, pull-requests: write` at
job level worked fine; refactoring to
`uses: .../release_please.yaml@master` without moving the permissions
block up broke three releases before anyone noticed.

## Quick Reference: GitHub App Permissions

The per-org integration Apps all have:

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| `actions: read` | Read workflow runs |
| `contents: write` | Push commits, create branches |
| `issues: write` | Renovate Dependency Dashboard |
| `metadata: read` | Required for all Apps |
| `packages: read` | Access ghcr.io private packages |
| `pull_requests: write` | Create/update Renovate PRs |
| `statuses: read` | Read commit statuses (integration gate) |
| `workflows: write` | Push changes to `.github/workflows/` |

Key rotation is tracked in JRL-18 (due 2027-04-11).
