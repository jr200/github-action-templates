# Lint GitHub Actions workflows for hardcoded runner OS labels.
#
# Policy: every `runs-on` must resolve through the org-level
# `vars.RUNNER_PROFILE` / `vars.RUNNER_PROFILES` indirection, so the
# entire org can flip between hosted and self-hosted runners by
# toggling one org var. Hardcoding `ubuntu-latest` etc. bypasses that
# switch and silently burns hosted-runner minutes when the org is
# meant to be on self-hosted (e.g. after a billing block).
#
# Allowed forms (regex-tested against the value after `runs-on:`):
#
#   ${{ fromJSON(vars.RUNNER_PROFILES)[vars.RUNNER_PROFILE].<tier> }}
#   ${{ inputs.runner || fromJSON(vars.RUNNER_PROFILES)[vars.RUNNER_PROFILE].<tier> }}
#   ${{ needs.*.outputs.* }}        — dynamic resolution from an earlier job (rare)
#   <self-hosted-label>             — explicit self-hosted label (uncommon; require an ALLOW line)
#
# Rejected: any literal matching /^(ubuntu|macos|windows)[-_]/, with or
# without a version suffix. That's the entire hosted-runner family.
#
# Usage:
#   lint-workflow-runners.sh [<workflows-dir>]
#     default: .github/workflows
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 all runs-on values compliant (or no workflow files present)
#   1 one or more hardcoded runner OS literals found
#   2 workflows dir missing
#
# Dependencies: bash, grep. No jq/yq — regex-only by design so the lint
# script has the smallest possible dependency footprint and can run in
# any minimal CI container.
