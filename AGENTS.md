# github-action-templates

Reusable GitHub Actions workflows + canonical caller workflows for jr200-labs / consumer orgs.

## Two halves

**`.github/workflows/`** — *reusable* workflows (`workflow_call`). Each implements one piece of CI/release machinery (lint, build, publish). Consumer repos call these via `uses:`. These are the underlying primitives.

**`consumers/`** — *caller* workflows. The one-line files that live in each consuming repo's `.github/workflows/` and just `uses:` a reusable. Consumers don't hand-author these; they're injected by `consumers/scripts/sync-shared` and held identical across repos by a drift-check.

## How a consuming repo uses this

1. Drop `.github/.shared-config.yaml` declaring which **groups** to opt into.
2. Run `./scripts/sync-shared` (or first-run `--bootstrap`) — fetches the canonical caller workflows for each declared group and writes them to `.github/workflows/`.
3. Commit. The `drift-check` workflow runs on every PR thereafter and fails CI if the on-disk files diverge from the canonical.

```yaml
# .github/.shared-config.yaml
ref: shared-v0.1.0
workflows:
  - hygiene        # conventional commits + lint-pr-metadata + drift-check + renovate + version downgrade guard
  - go             # ci-go
  - docker         # build-docker-image
  - release        # release-please
```

`ref` pins the canonical consumer files to a `github-action-templates` tag. Tags for this surface use `shared-vX.Y.Z`; consumers should move between them through Renovate PRs, not by tracking `master`. `SYNC_REF=<branch-or-tag> ./scripts/sync-shared` is only for one-off diagnostics or bootstrapping.

No string substitution, no archetype — files are verbatim copies. Per-repo divergence is captured by *which groups* the repo declares, not by parameters within a group.

## Groups

`consumers/groups/<name>.yaml` defines a group:

```yaml
includes:
  - lint-pr-metadata
  - commitlint
  - drift-check
  - renovate
```

Each entry names a workflow file in `consumers/workflows/`. Resolution unions all declared groups' `includes` lists and dedupes — so multi-language repos can list `python` and `node` together with overlapping members.

Current groups:

| Group | Pulls in | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `hygiene` | lint-pr-metadata, commitlint (Cocogitto conventional-commit check), drift-check, renovate, lint-version-downgrades | every repo that wants any CI |
| `python` | ci-python | repo has `pyproject.toml` |
| `node` | ci-node | repo has `package.json` |
| `node-bench` | node-bench | repo has a Node/pnpm benchmark workflow and wants the shared manual benchmark caller |
| `npm-package` | publish-npm-package | repo publishes a Node package to npmjs.com on release (needs `secrets.NPMJS_API_TOKEN`) |
| `go` | ci-go | repo has `go.mod` |
| `swift` | ci-swift | repo is a native Swift/Xcode app, including macOS app development |
| `docker` | build-docker-image | repo publishes a docker image to ghcr.io |
| `quarto-docs` | publish-quarto-docs | repo publishes a Quarto site from `docs` to `gh-pages` |
| `helm-chart` | build-helm-chart | repo publishes a Helm chart (needs `vars.HELM_CHART_REPO` + `secrets.CHARTS_WRITE_TOKEN`) |
| `wheel` | publish-wheel | repo publishes a wheel to PyPI (needs `secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN`) |
| `release` | release-please | repo cuts versioned releases |
| `oci-artifact` | publish-oci-artifact | repo publishes a generic OCI artifact bundle to GHCR on release |
| `drift-check-rulesets` | drift-check-rulesets | one consumer per org watches its own ruleset state |

For the `swift` group, keep the consumer caller generic. The reusable workflow
auto-detects a single `.xcodeproj` and then chooses the matching project-named
scheme, or the only shared scheme. Repos with multiple Xcode projects or
schemes should pass explicit `project` / `scheme` inputs from a bespoke caller
workflow rather than hard-coding one app's name into the canonical shared
workflow.

## Trigger model

`release-please.yaml` is the sole release fan-out. On a Release PR merge it cuts a tag + GitHub Release, then fires a single `repository_dispatch: release-published` event. Every artifact-publishing workflow (`build-docker-image.yaml`, etc.) listens on the same event type, so their callers can be verbatim across repos. Repos that don't publish docker simply omit `docker` from their groups; the dispatch fires anyway and goes nowhere.

## Adding a new group

1. Add `consumers/workflows/<workflow-name>.yaml` — the caller file. Must include a top-level `permissions:` block; see GOTCHAS.md #12.
2. Add `consumers/groups/<group-name>.yaml` listing it under `includes:`.
3. Update this doc.
4. Open PR. Merge.
5. The `release-shared-ref` workflow automatically tags the merged commit with the next `shared-vX.Y.Z` ref and publishes a GitHub Release with generated notes.
6. Repos opt in by adding `<group-name>` to their `.github/.shared-config.yaml`, bumping `ref:` to the new shared tag, and running `sync-shared`.

## Updating an existing canonical workflow

Edit `consumers/workflows/<name>.yaml` and merge to `master`. The `release-shared-ref` workflow tags the shared surface with the next `shared-vX.Y.Z` ref and publishes a GitHub Release with generated notes when `consumers/**` or `shared/**` changed. Consumer repos pin `.github/.shared-config.yaml` to one of those tags. Renovate watches that pin and opens a dedicated PR per consumer repo; the generated drift-repair workflow is the fallback if a checked-in caller file falls behind the pinned ref.

## Bespoke workflows

Consumer repos may keep additional non-canonical workflows alongside the
injected set, but they must be named `bespoke_*.yaml`. Drift-check ignores that
prefix when reporting workflows outside the resolved shared set. Any other
extra workflow filename is still surfaced as `stale-or-bespoke` so accidental
drift stays visible.

## Load-bearing properties

The canonical caller workflows encode invariants that are easy to break by hand and have bitten us before:

- **Top-level `permissions:`** — only the caller's *top-level* permissions cascade into reusable workflows. Job-level permissions on the caller are silently ignored when the caller invokes a reusable. Missing this on `build_docker_image.yaml` was the keymint v1.0.0 silent build failure.
- **Secret name match** — the reusable declares a secret name; the caller must pass it under exactly that name. `app_private_key` vs `INTEGRATION_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` is a one-character bug that fails the run at startup.
- **Runner forwarding** — every reusable that runs jobs takes a `runner:` input parameterised via `vars.RUNNER_PROFILES[vars.RUNNER_PROFILE].<role>`. Linux CI generally uses `default`; native Swift/Xcode macOS app CI uses `macos`. Hard-coded labels such as `ubuntu-latest` or `macos-latest` are forbidden.

## Tests: unit vs integration

The canonical `ci-python` / `ci-go` / `ci-node` / `ci-swift` callers run **lint/build + unit tests only**. For native Swift/Xcode macOS app development, `ci-swift` builds and tests the app scheme on a macOS runner with code signing disabled. Integration tests — anything that needs external infrastructure (database, message bus, S3, etc.) — stay **bespoke per repo** in a separate `integration-tests.yaml` workflow that owns its own service setup, fixtures, and secrets.

Why: each repo's external deps are different, so there's no canonical infra setup that fits every consumer. Pushing infra into the canonical CI would either reintroduce per-repo substitution (rejected — see "How a consuming repo uses this" above) or impose a one-size-fits-none stack on every Python/Go/Node repo.

How: canonical CI calls `pytest` (or `go test`, `vitest`) with the reusable's default flags. Each repo's test config (e.g. `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.pytest.ini_options].addopts = "-m 'not integration'"`) excludes the integration subset from default collection. Tests carrying the marker (e.g. `@pytest.mark.integration`) only run when a bespoke workflow opts them in.

Repos with infra-dependent tests that can't (yet) be split: stay on a fully bespoke `ci.yaml` and omit the language group from `.shared-config.yaml`. Drift-check warns on the bespoke file (`stale-or-bespoke: ...`) but doesn't fail. Track adoption per repo under JRL-33.

### Bespoke integration-tests checklist

When you write a repo's `integration-tests.yaml`, follow these structural rules so it shares the load-bearing properties of the canonical callers even though the content is bespoke:

- **Top-level `permissions:`** — minimum `contents: read`. Add `pull-requests: read` if any reusable inside needs it. Job-level perms on the caller don't cascade into reusables.
- **`runs-on:`** — always `${{ fromJSON(vars.RUNNER_PROFILES)[vars.RUNNER_PROFILE].default }}`. Never hard-code `ubuntu-latest`.
- **Private git deps** — mint an installation token via `actions/create-github-app-token@v3.1.1` with `client-id: ${{ vars.INTEGRATION_CLIENT_ID }}` and `private-key: ${{ secrets.INTEGRATION_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}`, then write `~/.netrc` for `uv sync` / `go mod download` to use.
- **Test selection** — invoke the marked subset only (`pytest -m integration`, `go test -tags integration`, `vitest --include 'tests/integration/**'`). Don't re-run unit tests; canonical CI already does.
- **Service containers** — declared at job level via `services:` with healthchecks. Connect via `localhost:<host-port>` from the runner.
- **Tooling install** — apt packages for client libs, binaries downloaded from GitHub releases, etc. Pin versions where it matters.

Reference: `jr200-labs/polars-hist-db/.github/workflows/integration-tests.yaml` (MariaDB service container + nats-server binary). Copy + modify; don't try to abstract until 3+ consumers exist with similar shapes (we have 1 today).

## Lint configs

Separate from the workflow injection: `shared/sync.sh` syncs canonical lint configs (ruff.toml, eslint.config.mjs, .golangci.yml, etc.) into `.shared/` in consumer repos. That mechanism predates `consumers/` and is unrelated; see `shared/MANIFEST.json`.

### Release-please config flow

`release-please-config.json` is a committed merged file in consumer repos.

- `.release-please.local.json` — committed per-repo override source for settings such as `release-type`
- `shared/release-please-config.base.json` — template-owned base config in this repo
- `release-please-config.json` — committed merge output at the consumer repo root, refreshed by `./.shared/sync.sh`

Rules:

- Do not hand-edit `release-please-config.json` in a consumer repo; update `.release-please.local.json` and re-run `./.shared/sync.sh`
- Commit both `.release-please.local.json` and the refreshed `release-please-config.json`
- Release-related CI should run `sync.sh` before linting so the checked-in merged config stays aligned with the committed overlay
