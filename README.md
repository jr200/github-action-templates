# github-action-templates

Reusable GitHub Actions workflows _and_ canonical caller workflows shared across consumer orgs, including native Swift/Xcode macOS app CI.

## Two halves

- **`.github/workflows/`** — *reusable* workflows (`workflow_call`). Each implements one piece of CI/release machinery. Consumer repos call these via `uses:`.
- **`consumers/`** — *caller* workflows. Each consuming repo declares groups in `.github/.shared-config.yaml`; `scripts/sync-shared` copies the matching caller files verbatim into `.github/workflows/`. A `drift-check` job in the `hygiene` group fails CI on any divergence. **Don't hand-author caller workflows.** See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full pattern.

Consumer repos should pin `.github/.shared-config.yaml` to a `shared-vX.Y.Z`
tag via `ref:`. Renovate tracks that pin and opens dedicated update PRs, so
shared workflow drift does not ride along with unrelated feature changes.
GAT releases the next `shared-vX.Y.Z` tag automatically when canonical
consumer workflows or shared files change on `master`, including a GitHub
Release with generated notes.

## Merge Policy

Both consumer orgs (`whengas/`, `jr200-labs`) enforce default-branch protection centrally: rulesets require PRs, repo settings disable auto-merge by default + enable branch auto-delete, and the `lint-no-auto-merge` workflow in `hygiene` fails CI if any caller workflow invokes `gh pr merge`, `--auto-merge`, or `gh pr review --approve`. Shared-ref auto-merge guardrails live in config for a future opt-in, but the feature is currently disabled.

## Important

**Read [GOTCHAS.md](GOTCHAS.md) before wiring up a new consumer.** It
covers cross-org secrets, GitHub Free plan limitations, App token quirks,
and other issues that are poorly documented upstream.
