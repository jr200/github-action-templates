# Validate release-please-config.json so misconfigurations are caught
# before release-please runs and silently degrades to its `node` default.
#
# Background. release-please defaults release-type to `node` when a
# package omits it. On a Python repo this manifests as
#   "release-please failed: Missing required file: package.json"
# AFTER the conventional-commit PR has been merged, blocking every
# subsequent release. The default is silent — no warning at PR time, no
# warning when the config is added — so the failure mode only surfaces
# when someone tries to ship.
#
# Rule enforced:
#   Every entry under .packages MUST set release-type explicitly
#   (or inherit from a top-level `release-type`). Marker-file
#   cross-checks were tried and dropped — repos legitimately mix
#   release-type=simple with a package.json (devDeps, tooling metadata, etc.),
#   making the cross-check more false-positive than catch.
#   Grouped and standalone Release PR title patterns MUST retain scope,
#   component, and version placeholders. Release PRs MUST remain separate so
#   Release Please does not erase component and version values when only a
#   non-root package is released.
#
# Usage: .shared/lint-release-please-config.sh [config-file]
#   config-file defaults to release-please-config.json
#
# Distributed via shared/sync.sh (common.cache → .shared/) and invoked
# by the release_please reusable workflow as a fail-fast pre-step. For
# repos using the merged template config, failures should point directly
# at .release-please.local.json so the next agent can repair the source
# of truth instead of hand-editing the merged config.
